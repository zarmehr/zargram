### _**Zargram**_
_**Zargram**_ is a small social network based on rest api that allows 
you to use basic social network procedures such as:  

-create/update/delete  accounts/posts/comments/reactions  
-(un)follow/delete friends  
-archive posts ,upload/update avatar

For this project **gin gonic** framework is used in order to work
with http service requests, **gorm** for operations with database,
postgreSQL, and jwt for authorization. For a design pattern I used **dependency injection**  

Requirements:
1. CRUD for users 
2. CRUD for posts  
3. CRUD for stories
4. CRUD for comments
5. Add a friend
6. Unfriend user 
7. CRUD for followers      
8. Sends post to archive         
9. Reactions to posts
10. Number of reactions
11. Uploads avatar   
12. Save post of another user
13. Search Users
